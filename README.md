# Module_14 - Algorithmic Trading

As a financial advisor at one of the top five financial advisory firms in the world, I am constantly competing with the other major firms to manage and automatically trade assets in a highly dynamic environment.  In recent years, we have heavily profited by using computer algorithms that can buy and sell faster than human traders.  The speed of these transactions gave my firm a competitive advantage early on.  But people still need to specifically program these systems, which limits our ability to adapt to new data.  Therefore we are planning to improve the existing algorithmic trading systems and maintain the firm's competitive advantage in the market. To do so, Iâ€™ll enhance the existing trading signals with machine learning algorithms that can adapt to new data.

## Baseline Trading Algorithm

The baseline trading algorithm uses the SVC classifier model from SKLearn's support vector machine (SVM) learning method to fit the training data and make predictions based on the testing data.  The training data for this baseline uses the first 3 months of actual return data.  The trading signals use short- and long-window SMA values, with a short window of 4 days and a long windown of 100 days.  Cumulative returns were as follows:

## Tuning the Baseline Trading Algorithm

* Step 1: Tune the training algorithm by adjusting the size of the training dataset.
  * Decreasing the training dataset from 3 months to just one month produced slightly lower strategy returns
  * Increasing the training dataset to 6 months increased the cumulative strategy returns from about 50% to approximately 80%


* Step 2: Tune the trading algorithm by adjusting the SMA input features.
  * Increasing the slow SMA window from 100 days to 200 days resulted in much lower strategy returns
  * Increasing the fast SMA window from 4 days to 10 days also reduced the strategy returns, but not as much as the change above
  * Decreasing teh slow SMA window to 50 days also had a negative effect, though much smaller than the two changes above


* Step 3: Choose the set of parameters that best improved the trading algorithm returns.
  * The optimal trading algorithm uses baseline SMA windows of 4 days and 100 days, but increases the training period to 6 months from the baseline of 3 months.  Cumulative strategy returns for this tuned trading algorithm are shown below:
